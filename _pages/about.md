Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/) at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), fortunate to be advised by Assistant Professor [Yifang Ma](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=mayf&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2). I previously received my M.S. in Statistics from the same department under the supervision of Professor [Guoliang Tian](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=tiangl&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2).

My research lies at the intersection of Computational Social Science, Network Science, Science of Science, and Innovation Studies. I examine how scholarly behaviors, institutional hierarchies, and collaboration networks shape scientific innovation and knowledge production, as well as how recognition and structural conditions influence the careers of women researchers. I am interested in interdisciplinary applications of data science, particularly in developing methods that generate actionable insights for science policy and evaluation.

Methodologically, I specialize in statistical modeling, causal inference, and large-scale data analysis, with end-to-end experience from data collection to visualization.

**I am currently seeking postdoctoral or research opportunities in computational social science, network analysis, or gender and equity studies in academia. Please feel free to reach out if you know of relevant opportunities or would like to connect.**
